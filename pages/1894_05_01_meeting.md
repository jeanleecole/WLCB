They had made use of the Peabody Library, of the Reports of the United States Ethnological Society, of the Congressional Library, and of the works of Isaac Taylor and other authorities on this line of studies.

Mrs. Wrenshall hopes to arouse a little more general interest and enthusiasm in Archaeology than has hitherto been shown in our Club. She spoke of the comprehensiveness of the study of Archaeology, of the opportunities given by it for gaining knowledge in History, Science, Art and Religion, of bringing before us the beauty and work of Greece and Rome,--and of the far away Orient. Also of unravelling the unknown past of America, and of

[131]

reading everywhere in ancient mounds and rude dolmens and Cyclopean piles as well as in beautiful temples and monuments the progress of the human race. And of scaling the heights inviting us, and entering the palaces where portals are open before us.

The Chairman of the Committee on the Exact Study of the English Language, Miss [Emma Fenwick] Brent, said that she regretted the many interruptions in the work of this Committee which our former President Mrs. [Francese Litchfield] Turnbull, had wished might continue its usefulness, and which she herself hoped might next year be more successful than during this season. This Committee had given one meeting at which papers were presented by Miss [Maria H.] Middleton, Mrs. Latimer, Miss [Sally K.] Carter, Mrs. [Henry C.] Evans and the Chairman herself. Miss Brent also spoke of the language and of the importance of preserving etymology in order to understand the history of words. She spoke of words as keeping us in touch with human nature in former times, like the phonograph, they give us messages from other times and places, they preserve the teaching of Science, and lead us to noble ends in the future.
