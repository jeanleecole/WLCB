### Board of Management. May 1st, 1894.

The Board of Management of the Woman's Literary Club of Baltimore held a meeting on Tuesday, May 1st, 1894, at the corner of Cathedral and Franklin Streets.

Miss Grace came late.

The President called the meeting to order, and after some suggestions with regard to the conduct of business,--reminded us that the first business in order was the presentation of the names of candidates for membership in our Club, this being the occasion of voting upon them.

Twenty new names were read to the Board; but one of them was--solely on account of irregularity in the presentation--not acted upon.

The nineteenth name was that of Miss Martha Ford, proposed by Mrs. Manly, and seconded by Miss Malloy. She was also unanimously elected.

The President then spoke of the approaching election for officers of the Club, and of the necessity for a system of rules in this election. We were reminded of the "Election Rules offered for Trial["] by the Minority of the special Committee on Amendments to the Constitution last Fall. Mrs. Johnson moved that a trial should be made of these rules at the approaching election. Miss Balch seconded the motion, and it was carried without opposition. We were reminded that the printed sheets filled up with the nominating lists of the members ought to be in

[77]

the hands of the proper Committee before the 14th of May if possible.

The election rule requiring that a Committee of five members of the Club shall be appointed by the President to receive and classify the nominating sheets of the members was now considered; and the President appointed as this Committee: Mrs. Wylie--Mrs. Carter,--Mrs. Wrenshall,--Miss Haughton,--and Miss Cloud, or--if Miss Cloud should decline to serve--the fifth member might be Mrs. Percy [Elizabeth McCormick] Reese.

The question arose whether this Committee should be taken from the ranks of the Club, exclusive of the Board of Management--or not? Mrs. Johnson suggested that it would not make much difference either way; but said she thought it would be the wiser plan not to include any member of the Board of Management in this Committee. Mrs. Wrenshall said the Board ought to be represented in it.

Miss Haughton said she would decline to serve on this Committee.

Mrs. Johnson moved that this Committee do not include members of the Board of Management, Miss

[78]

Grace seconded the motion;--but it was defeated.--The meeting adjourned.

--Some of the members appointed to serve on this Committee on Election declining to serve, it became finally: Mrs. Wylie,--Mrs. Carter,--Mrs. Wrenshall,--Mrs. Whitelock,--and Mrs. Goddard.
